This repo is a fork of EasyMDE which is a fork of SimpleMDE.

The main purpose of this fork is to serve my Markius project as a WYSIWYG markdown editor and the original repo lacks certain APIs I need.

This repo would rewrite the original repo in a es class style and it should expose the these apis below:

1. `preview` and `edit` toggle
2. `bold`, `italic`, `quote`, etc.
